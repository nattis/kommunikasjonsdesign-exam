        <h3>Anette (36) from Bærum is a full-time student who lives in Halden. In 2023, she will be a map reader in the rally race Africa Eco Tour, which runs from Monaco in southern Europe all the way to Dakar in West Africa.</h3>
        <p>When Anette was 5 years old, her dad came home with a "crosser" that was a tad big that he had bought as a birthday present in Belgium.</p>
        <p>– Map reader does 50% of the work if not more. The fact that I navigate us correctly is so important.</p>

        <p>Christina Dobloug is the rally driver who will be behind the wheel the more than 3000 kilometres it will take to get all the way to Dakar in Senegal.</p>
        <p>– We must be very cohesive: it is not certain that you have time to say full words. If you have a turn combination of right and then left, you may just have to say "hø" and then you will say "ve". We’re talking about speeds at 200 kph!</p>

        <p>There are not that many people that are in the African Eco Race. It is very special that there is a pure women's car, and it has never happened before from Norway. So, we must be role models and show that this is possible! This is possible!</p>
        <p>When Anette was only 3-4 years old, her brother watched motocross on TV.</p>
        <h4><b>How did it start for you as a 5-year-old? What caught your attention with motorsports?</b></h4>
        <p>– My brother. I have a big brother who is 7 years older than me. He had seen motocross on TV (mopeds). That made him want to try it. Then dad found a local motorsport club in Bærum, and my brother got his own crosser. And then I was with them and watched as he trained. At the time I was probably 3-4 years old, and standing and pulling my dad in a sweater and saying, "I want to drive too!". I was very active as a child. Happily, hung upside down in the curtain and was a bit like a monkey.</p>
        <p>In 2001 Anette dislocated her shoulder. However, that did not stop her from participating in competitions. </p>

        <p>– In the European Championships in 2002 Oslo, I got 2nd place. Ola was one of Norway's best several times. Andreas was a member of the club who drove a lot, but never reached the top.</p>
        <p>In 2004, Annette had to have surgery on her shoulder. She thus lost her professional contract.</p>
        <p>The helmet looked like it was going to stay on the shelf.</p>
        
        <h4><b>What does it mean for you to be a role model?</b></h4>
        <p>– I had no starting point, I myself felt that I would never get to this point, or higher education for that matter!</p>
        <p>– So, I hope that I can be a role model for others who feel that "No, I cannot do this", no matter what it should be! Because yes: you can do this!</p>

        <h4><b>What have you learned?</b></h4>
        <p>– I have learned that what I say to myself is very important. If I have wanted to do something and not do it then… I was very good at finding excuses why I shouldn’t take that jog. Or why I did not need higher education, or why it did not go so well with that race at the time.</p>
        <p>– Having faith in oneself too. Keep a straight back and be a little proud of what you have managed to accomplish. For some it may be just getting up one day, while for others it may be carrying out a desert rally.</p>
