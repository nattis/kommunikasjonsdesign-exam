        <h3>The old water- and drainage systems in Halden are proving a cost the environment, as well as a risk to the public health. The municipality says they are working intensely on fixing them.  </h3>

        <p>There is a lot that can be done with the water and drainage systems. People don’t know that the water is leaking like a sieve in Halden, Thor Moen says. </p>
        <p>SSB reports that the water systems in Halden, are on average 41 years old (<a href="https://cdn.tu.no/vannkart/index.html">Teknisk Ukeblad</a>). </p>
        <p id="water0">There are old systems that no politicians want to stick their head out for and invest in, because of the high cost. </p>
        <p2><a href="https://cdn.tu.no/vannkart/index.html">Teknisk ukeblad</a> reports the following numbers: </p2>
        <section id="water">
            <h4 id="water56"></h4>
            <h4 id="water32"></h4>
            
        </section>  
        <p>If we were able to fix the leaks and raise awareness about water consumption, we can save energy and lower CO2 emissions.</p>
        <p>When asked, Martine Ringdal – environmental consultant for Halden municipality, tells us that the leaks in Halden are far from overlooked.</p>
        <p>Of course, there is an energy effectivization by not having to cleanse water that is just leaking. </p>
        <p>She recalls that we produce 140% of the actual need for clean drinking water in order to compensate.</p>
        <p>There is set aside a good amount of money and this is worked intensely on. The municipality are installing smart sensors in the pipes in order to faster detect leakage. It would be great being able to stop the leaks quickly.</p>
        <p>They are also working on separating rain water from the wastewater, so we don’t have to spend energy on cleansing already safe water going into nature. Up till now, much have gone down the same pipes, being sent to the treatment plant. </p>
        <p>This is what they have been working on in Gimlebakken, project leader Ruben Ajorro told <a href="https://www.ha-halden.no/na-er-denne-veien-stengt-apner-ikke-for-til-hosten/s/5-20-961642">Halden Arbeiderblad</a>.</p>
        <p>In addition to the environmental cost, the leaking of water- and drainage systems may also cause serious health risks for the population, as sewer lines may potentially be leaking into the drinking water. </p>
        <p>The work of replacing and repairing faulty water pipes is going so slowly that the problem of contaminated drinking water is likely to increase in the years to come, <a href="https://www.ha-halden.no/nyheter/fare-for-kloakk-i-drikkevannet/s/1-2906373-5131487">Halden Arbeiderblad</a> wrote in 2010.</p>
