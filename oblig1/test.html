			<p>Alex (21) and his local community are tired of the "border issue". </p>
			<p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Enningdalens three border crossings have been closed. </p>
			<p>Using them is now illegal. Arrests are fined with 10 000 NOK.</p>
			<p>This means many people in Enningdalen are not allowed to visit their local grocery store, or even see their close relatives.</p>
			<p>But they have found their ways around.</p>
				

			<h4><i>– Tell us about this phenomenon of people dropping each other off by the border. Have you done it? </i></h4>
			<p>– Yes I have done it, several times actually. I used to drop my grandmother off at the border, and my dad sometimes. </p>

			<h4><i>– What was it like?</i> </h4>
			<p>– I mean it was kind of scary the first time, but it went better than expected.</p>

			<p>Enningdalen has three official border crossings on Berby, Vassbotn and Kornsjø.</p>

			<p>The area is like an arm stretching into Sweden. 
				Due to its peculiar location, 
				many people living there have strong connections 
				to Sweden with their daily errands and family. </p>

			<h4><i>– Were you nervous? </i></h4>
			<p>– I was nervous about getting caught, but I know where the police or customs usually are, so I made sure before going to the border that they were somewhere else. </p>

			<p>200 meters into Sweden from the Kornsjø, 
				there is a little store called "Kornsjö loppis and cafe". 
				According to an acquaintance of Alex, 
				people walk to this store often, even while the 
				police and customs are there. 
				He says that the authorities don't even care, 
				as long as you just visit the store and don't 
				disappear out of sight. </p>

			<p>Alex’s acquaintance and some of his neighbours at 
				Kornsjø have been resorting
				to even more creative solutions.
				During the winter, the ice at <i>Enningdalsvassdraget</i> 
				was so thick that he and some friends were 
				able to drive into Sweden, crossing the frozen lake.</p>
			
			<p>Though the penalty of crossing the border illegally is fined with 10 000 NOK, people in Enningdalen are still trespassing at a high rate. Alex tells us that none of his neighbours doing this, has ever been stopped by the police. </p>

			<h4><i>– Do you think more people should be doing it?</i></h4>
			<p>– There are far more doing it than you might think. One time my grandfather living in Sweden, was delivering something to me on the border. I suddenly noticed two cars coming from each side of the border. I saw four people get out of one car, walking into Sweden and getting into the other car, waiting for them there. </p>

			<h4><i>– How do you feel the government is responding to the issue?</i></h4>
			<p>– I mean it's hard for them to stay guard on all border crossings all the time – they just don’t have enough people for that. The customs have cameras on many of the border crossings, so if they really wanted to I think they could catch the people doing this. But as I said, they simply don’t have enough resources. </p>
